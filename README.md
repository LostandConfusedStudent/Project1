This is our first project. Due to COVID-19, people have been instructed to quarantine themselves to prevent the spread of the virus. However, many people are bored from staying at home 24/7. Our goal is to create an application that allows users to look up a country they would like to visit and book a trip. The purpose is to show users whether or not their travel plans can become a reality. If not, then options that can provide a similar experience will be suggested.

Objective 1:

Create submit form where users can enter a country of interest.

Objective 2:

If desired country is available, then an option to book a trip will be displayed.

Objective 3:

If desired country is under a travel ban, then a list of local restaurants that serve similar meals will be displayed.

Objective 4:

If there are no restaurants, then a list of recipes that are similar to the desired meals will be displayed.
